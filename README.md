# c-helloworld-docker
A simplest possible, remotely debugged c program for a docker container.

## Notes:
* Official [archlinux docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/archlinux) does not come with gdb or lldb installed, this is why this demo uses a customized image.
* Visual studio code launch and tasks configurations for remote debugging are intentionally included in this repository.
